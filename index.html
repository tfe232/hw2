        Hi! My name is Tom Farmer, creator of this website. I was born in the UK, immigrated here in 1987, and have enjoyed exploring new places ever since. Recently, my trips have mostly revolved around the absurd amount of people getting married and having destination weddings (myself included) but I’ve been able to sneak in a trip or two outside of that time. Here is some info on two countries I recently visited:

      England – birthplace of Shakespeare and The Beatles – is a country in the British Isles bordering Scotland and Wales. The capital, London, on the River Thames, is home of Parliament and the 11th-century Tower of London, but is also a multicultural, 21st-century hub for the arts and business in "The City." Other large cities are Manchester, Birmingham, Liverpool, Bristol and the university centres of Oxford and Cambridge.

      Croatia is an Eastern European country with long coastlines on the Adriatic Sea, encompassing more than a thousand islands, crossed by the Dinaric Alps and dotted with castles. Its inland capital, Zagreb, is distinguished by its medieval Gornji Grad (Upper Town) and diverse museums. The major coastal city Dubrovnik has massive 16th-century walls encircling an Old Town with Gothic and Renaissance buildings.

              This country is a massive South American nation with terrain encompassing Andes mountains, glacial lakes and Pampas grassland, the traditional grazing ground of its famed beef cattle. The country is known for tango, steak and football. Its big, cosmopolitan capital, Buenos Aires, is centered on the 16th-century Plaza de Mayo, lined with stately buildings including Casa Rosada, the iconic, balconied presidential palace.
